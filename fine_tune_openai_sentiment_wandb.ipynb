    "This notebook explores fine-tuning GPT Models for sentiment analysis using Weights & Biases. Our experiment will lead to an overall accuracy boost, and we'll delve into applications. In today's data-driven world, sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in discerning public opinion on a myriad of topics. Advanced models like GPT Model, built on the GPT architecture, offer immense potential in understanding and interpreting human emotions from textual data. However, like many tools, their out-of-the-box capabilities might not capture the nuanced intricacies of sentiment, especially in diverse datasets like those from Reddit. This article dives deep into the process of fine-tuning GPT Models for sentiment analysis, utilizing the powerful features of the Weights & Biases platform, and delves into the improvements and challenges faced."

    "## How Can a GPT Model Be Used for Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT Model's ability to understand natural language makes it a good fit for sentiment analysis. This is because, unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined responses, GPT Models generate real-time answers based on a vast amount of training data. This approach enables it to provide responses that are contextually relevant and informed by a broad spectrum of information. \n"

    "## Fine-Tuning GPT Model for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning is a pivotal step in adapting a general-purpose models, like GPT Models, to a specific task such as sentiment analysis. A GPT Model, with its broad language understanding capabilities, can grasp a vast array of topics and concepts. However, sentiment analysis is more than just comprehending text; it requires a nuanced understanding of subjective tones, moods, and emotions.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Think about sarcasm. Understanding sarcasm is tricky, even for humans sometimes. Sarcasm is when we say something but mean the opposite, often in a joking or mocking way. For example, if it starts raining just as you're about to go outside, and you say, \"Oh, perfect timing!\" you're probably being sarcastic because it's actually bad timing. Now, imagine a machine trying to understand this. Without special training, it might think you're genuinely happy about the rain because you said \"perfect.\" This is where fine-tuning a model like GPT Model becomes crucial.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "GPT Model, out of the box, is pretty good at understanding a lot of text. It's read more than most humans ever will. But sarcasm is subtle and often needs context. So, to make GPT Models really get sarcasm, we'd expose it to many examples of sarcastic sentences until it starts catching on to the patterns. But here's the catch: sarcasm doesn't look the same everywhere. In different cultures or situations, what's sarcastic in one place might be meant seriously in another. That's why just general knowledge isn't enough. The model needs specific examples to truly grasp the playful twists and turns of sarcasm. In short, to make GPT Model understand sarcasm like a human, it needs extra training on it, just like someone might need to watch several comedy shows to start understanding a comedian's sense of humor."

    "In this notebook, we'll leverage a Reddit dataset sourced from Kaggle, available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cosmos98/twitter-and-reddit-sentimental-analysis-dataset. This dataset features two key columns: clean_comment(the sentiment text) and its corresponding category (sentiment label).\n",

    "### Data Augmentation Sentiment Analysis Dataset for Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the refined Fine-Tuning GPT Model process mandates a specific data structure in a JSONL file for optimal training. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a JSONL File?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `.jsonl` file (short for JSON Lines) is a file format used to store structured data, typically for machine learning and data processing applications. Each line in a `.jsonl` file is a separate, self-contained JSON object. This makes it particularly useful for handling large datasets that can be processed line-by-line, avoiding loading everything into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Features of JSONL Format:\n",
    "- **One JSON Object Per Line:** Each line in the file is an independent JSON object.\n",
    "- **Line-Delimited:** The objects are separated by newlines (`\\n`), not by commas or brackets as in standard JSON.\n",
    "- **Efficient Parsing:** Line-by-line processing is easy and efficient, which is helpful when working with large datasets.\n",
    "- **No Root Structure:** Unlike regular JSON, there is no outer array or object enclosing the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of a JSONL File:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}]}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?\"}]}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How far is the Moon from Earth?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Around 384,400 kilometers. Give or take a few, like that really matters.\"}]}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "- **Training Data for Machine Learning Models:** Frequently used in NLP tasks where each line contains an individual record (e.g., a sentence with a label).\n",
    "- **Log Data Storage:** Each log entry is a separate JSON object.\n",
    "- **Streaming Data Processing:** Ideal for scenarios where you process data incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Work with JSONL:\n",
    "- **Reading and Writing:** In Python, you can use the `json` or `jsonlines` library to read and write JSONL files.\n",
    "- **Tools:** Many tools like `jq`, Pandas, and other data processing libraries support the JSONL format.\n"

    "### The Importance of High-Quality Training Data for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "High-quality training data is pivotal for sentiment analysis as it ensures the model learns to accurately distinguish nuances in emotions. Poor data can lead to misinterpretations, reducing the effectiveness of the analysis. Moreover, comprehensive and well-curated data can significantly boost the model's ability to generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. The dataset we're utilizing underscores this point. As even some of its entries are so nuanced that even humans might struggle to discern their sentiment."
