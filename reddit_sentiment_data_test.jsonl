other things actually quite dangerous and has been accused inspiring the dhaka terror attackers now would certainly understand this guy were fringe but enjoys widespread popularity much that parties such the iuml and the aimim came support him focus far away international events while ignoring nearer problems home was reading wiki article the iranian election protests 2009 against alleged vote rigging the authorities support ahmadenijad today while scrolling down the article saw the various cities where protests were held most were inside iran while some were cities where there were sizeable number iranian diasporas naturalised iranian citizens but among all those cities was hyderabad too indian hyderabad don yet understand this why did some people hyderabad feel attached the elections iran that they protested against the results what are the priorities why does event quarter way across the world hold sway why similarly just don understand why there were riots azad maidan due events myanmar myanmar india ofcourse not why were there riots you see buddhist groups rioting india because they persecuted malaysia you see the hindu groups rioting because the hindus are oppressed pakistan the same way you see the christians rioting the same way because they oppressed pakistan partition this was horrific event what important that the muslim majority provinces india had muslim league governments power most the eligible voters was based limited franchise voted for the muslim league why that most the muslim voters undivided india voted for the muslim league while most the hindu voters ditched the communal hindu mahasabha vote for the congress which was largely secular this isn focused india but nevertheless have you heard the undhr its global consensus based charter basic principles focused highlighting basic human rights which should enjoyed each and every human regardless their identities its ideals are lofty and universal now have you heard the cairo declaration human rights was charter made and signed almost all members the organisation islamic countries was made opposition the unhdr which was condemned the oic members being based judeo christian values firstly ironical them oppose the unhrd because they based judeo christian values isn moses prophet islam isn jesus prophet islam why are the oic countries opposed the norms which are allegedly derived from the values which these prophets valued and practiced secondly and importantly the cairo declaration seemingly restricts the rights non muslims and declares shariat being the source law making note there other parallel cdhr nations belonging other religions such hinduism and buddhism question the whole world finds the unhdr lofty and ideal then why the muslim majority states have problem with much they were forced create restrictive alternative how you justify religious rule our history replete with muslim kings being harsh towards non muslims curtailing their rights compared muslims while the past past don understand why some these potentially divisive figures are marketed being the paragons tolerance some members the community for example aurangzeb considered mujhadid islamic reformer who saved amd rejuvenated islam some you think that figure divisive this being looked upto good guy step towards good relations ofcourse not edit why did the pew poll 2003 show majority indonesia tolerant country supporting osama confidence osama poll 2005 showed osama support pakistan the poll was held just the aftermath instead anger and resentment there was approval osama the opinions these states pakistan and indonesia dropped turned against him only after started targeting the civilians the muslim majority countries why was high the first place just because americans indians spainards and the french were attacked aren these humans just like the rest edit why are muslims states such and the the least integrated community the considered the western world christian fundamentalism citadel and yet overall going polls christians are rather marginally better terms accepting socially progressive views why that the muslim community appears the bottom the list

threat posed the dormant hindu majority serious danger his\ncommunity saw the political decline muslims the subcontinent prelude total religious disintegration his fears were further accentuated the misunderstanding and some instances ignorance islam his community mainly result centuries long interaction with the hindu community well the recent contact with western\nthought\nhence shah wali allah

preserve their\ndistinct identity being different from the rest the indian communities and particularly\nthe hindus order muslims should restrict their interaction with the latter else\nislamic values would completely obliterated confirmed hafeez malik the below\nstatement while the hindu culture has always been assimilative and\nwilling synthesize with other religions islam had face the\nproblem preserving its distinct identity which closer cultural\nrelations with the hindu society would progressively erode shah wali allah uttered cry for islam danger the south asian subcontinent and muslim theologian felt duty bound something save his religion and religionists\nfrom further disintegration thus and his followers embarked revivalist and\nreformist campaign amongst the muslim community british india that encouraged\ncommunal tendencies and attitudes common muslims only mainly religious thinking\ntowards that end urged his community return the islamic religion seek\nsalvation stated
